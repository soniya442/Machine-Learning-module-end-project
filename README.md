Summary of the Car Price Prediction Project
Objective
The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features. A Chinese automobile company, planning to enter the U.S. market, needed insights into the key factors affecting car prices to optimize their pricing and design strategies.

Approach Taken
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Handled missing values and removed duplicate rows.

Converted categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

Model Implementation:

Implemented five regression models:
âœ… Linear Regression
âœ… Decision Tree Regressor
âœ… Random Forest Regressor
âœ… Gradient Boosting Regressor
âœ… Support Vector Regressor

Model Evaluation:

Compared models using RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Identified the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Feature Importance Analysis:

Used Random Forest's feature importance to determine the most influential variables in predicting car prices.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

Observed improvements in prediction accuracy after tuning.

Key Findings
âœ… Random Forest Regressor performed best with the highest RÂ² score and lowest error metrics.
âœ… Features like engine size, horsepower, and curb weight were significant in determining car prices.
âœ… Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy.

Conclusion
This project successfully built a robust machine learning model to predict car prices. The insights gained will help the company make informed decisions about car design, pricing, and competitive positioning in the U.S. automobile market. ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
